# `onelearn`: machine learning lgorithms for ONline LEARNing

This `GitHub` repository contains for now the algorithms described in the paper

It provides mainly the `AMFClassifier` and the `AMFRegressor`, together with a weak 
baseline called `OnlineDummyClassifier`. 


## Run the experiments from the paper

Once inside the container you can simply run the scripts to reproduce the experiments of the paper. For instance

```bash
python plot_decisions.py
```
