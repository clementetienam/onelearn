# `onelearn`: machine learning lgorithms for ONline LEARNing

This `GitHub` repository contains for now the algorithms described in the paper

> *AMF: Aggregated Mondrian Forests for Online Learning*
> 
> by J. Mourtada, S. GaÃ¯ffas and E. Scornet
> 
> arXiv link: http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10529

It provides mainly the `AMFClassifier` and the `AMFRegressor`, together with a weak 
baseline called `OnlineDummyClassifier`. 


Running the experiments requires the installation of scikit-garden, for a comparison
with Mondrian forests.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scikit-garden/scikit-garden.git && \
    cd scikit-garden && \
    python setup.py build install
```
